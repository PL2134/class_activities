# FinTech Case Study

In this activity, you will put together all of the skills you have learned so far. Work by yourself and create a FinTech case study report. It should be written in a markdown file and hosted on a shared GitHub repository.

Be prepared to share your findings with the class!

## Instructions

Complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to the class **GitLab** [resource](https://sydney.bootcampcontent.com/university-of-sydney/USYD-VIRT-FIN-PT-09-2022-U-LOLC/-/tree/main/01-Intro-to-FinTech/3/Activities/04-Stu_Group_Case_Study/Resources) folder and choose one of the case study proposals from the list. 

2. Open **GitHub** and create a new repository with a README file.

3. Research the FinTech case study you chose. Provide answers to the following:

    * What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?

    * How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?

    * Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

    * What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?

4. Modify the `README` file to include the following features. **Note:** The list below includes the minimum requirements. Feel free to add other markdown features!

    * **Level 1 heading:** A title for the FinTech case study

    * **Image:** An image relevant to the case study

    * **Level 2 heading for description:** A description header

    * **Description content:** Content for the description

    * **Contributors:** The names of everyone in your group and optionally a contact e-mail.

5. Create a new markdown file named `company_case_study.md` where you should replace the word `company` with the name of the company you choose to write your case study about (e.g. `starbucks_case_study.md`). Include the following structure in your document.

    * **Level 1 heading:** A title for the FinTech case study report

    * **Case study content:** Content for the case study

6. Push the changes to the shared GitHub repository.

7. Navigate to your GitHub repository and confirm the changes. 

8. Done!




### Merge Conflicts, if there is any

Be aware of merge conflicts if there is any. That is, be careful not to create separate versions of the file, as git will not know which version should take precedence.
